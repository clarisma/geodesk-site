We are an independent team of developers with interest in cartography and all things
geospatial. We're avid supporters of OpenStreetMap ("OSM"); however, we are not affiliated with, or endorsed or sponsored by OSM. OpenStreetMap, OSM and the OSM logo are trademarks

## About OpenStreetMap

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) is a collaboratively-edited map of the whole world. Its dataset is distributed free of charge under the [Open Database License](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Database_License). The scope of the project has grown way beyond its original goal of providing a freely-available road atlas, and now covers a vast range of geographic features. In most parts of the world, the completeness and quality of the dataset is equal (and often superior) to paid commercial options, making OpenStreetMap an excellent resource for geospatial applications.
