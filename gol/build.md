# `build`

Creates a new feature library from an OpenStreetMap data file.

Usage:

    gol build [<options>] <gol-file> <source-file>

`<gol-file>` is the name of the library to build. If no extension is given, `.gol` will be added.

`<source-file>` is the file that contains the OpenStreetMap data. Currently, only files in [OSM-PBF format](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format) are supported. This format is popular due to its compact size and wide tool support.

## Sources of OpenStreetMap data

A complete copy of the worldwide map data (updated weekly) is available for download on the [OSM website](https://planet.osm.org/). Because of the size of the download (multiple gigabytes) and limited server bandwidth, it is highly recommended to use [torrents](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm#BitTorrent).

A better alternative may be using a [mirror](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm#Planet.osm_mirrors), or a provider of [processed datasets](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Processed_data_providers).

If you are looking for regional or country-sized subsets, [GeoFabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/) offers a large selection of datasets (updated daily).

## Hardware requirements

Building a library is a resource-intense operation. To build a GOL that contains the worldwide OpenStreetMap dataset, you should have a machine with at least 8 physical cores and 24 MB of RAM, or the build process may take multiple hours. 

For smaller datasets, any reasonably modern machine will do fine (a 10-year-old dual-core laptop with 8 GB RAM will build country-size datasets such as Germany, France or Japan in about 20 minutes each). A fast solid-state drive is recommended in any case. 

Your drive should have free space equal to at least three times the size of the .osm.pbf file (in addition to that file). So if you wish to download the planet file (currently 60 GB) and turn it into a GOL, you should have 240 GB of disk space available. 

The resulting GOL itself will only be 30% to 50% larger than the planet file (The additional storage is needed to accommodate temporary files).

An alternative to building a GOL is downloading a GeoDesk tile set (via the [`load`](load) command). This is much faster and requires only minimal hardware.

## Options

### `-c`, <code>--config=<em>&lt;FILE&gt;</em></code>

Instructs the command to use a specific configuration file.

If the option is specified without a value, the program writes a configuration file
containing the default settings to the path where the library would be created,
without actually building the library itself. The user can then customize these
settings and invoke the `build` command again.

For example, `gol build gols/planet -c` creates `planet.fab` in the `gols` folder.

### `-k`, `--keep-work`

Retains the temporary files generated by the build process (instead
  of deleting them by default). If you might want to change a setting and rebuild the
  library, adding this option may significantly cut the build time by re-using work
  done by the previous invocation of the command. It does, however, increase the required
  amount of disk space.
