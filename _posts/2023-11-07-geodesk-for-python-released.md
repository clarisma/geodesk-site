We are excited to announce our first release of **GeoDesk for Python**: Query, analyze, display and transform OpenStreetMap features using the worldâ€™s most popular scripting language --- on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

- Store the entire world-wide OSM dataset locally in under 100 GB (or any extract you wish)
 
- Query features based on type, tags and spatial relationships (e.g. `intersects`, `within`, `contains`, `connects_to`) --- 50x faster than SQL
 
- Measure features: length, area, distance
 
- Explore object graphs (nodes of ways, members of relations)

- Obtain geometric shapes and process them using Shapely (Python wrapper for GEOS)
 
- Convert features to various formats (just GeoJSON and WKT for now, but more are coming)
 
- 100% free & open-source

## Try it now!

- Install the [Python](https://www.python.org) package: `pip install geodesk`

- [Download the GOL Tool](https://www.geodesk.com/download) (builds GeoDesk databases from `.osm.pbf` files)
