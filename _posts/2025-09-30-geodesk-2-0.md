We’re excited to announce GeoDesk 2.0 — a major upgrade with a brand-new GOL Tool and faster, simplified workflows.

- The GOL Tool is now a stand-alone executable (< 1 MB), no JVM required (supports Windows, Linux and both Intel/ARM macOS)

- 2x to 10x faster operations: build a planet-scale GOL in 15 minutes; extract all the world’s rivers as GeoJSON in seconds

- Simplified command options, progress bars, and colorized output

- `gol query` now includes an interactive mode for complex queries

- Visualize query results instantly with the new `gol map` command

See the full list in the [release notes](https://github.com/clarisma/geodesk-gol/releases/tag/2.0.0).

We’ve redesigned the GOL format to be even more compact and efficient, and to enable incremental updates. Full update support will ship later this year.

The new format requires GeoDesk SDK 2.0 or later. While the query API remains unchanged, you should see performance gains from the upgrades.

To ease the transition, we’ll continue maintaining the 1.x line. Documentation for 1.x remains available at [docs1.geodesk.com](https://docs1.geodesk.com/).
