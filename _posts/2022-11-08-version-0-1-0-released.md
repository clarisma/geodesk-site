We are pleased to release GeoDesk Version 0.1 EA.

As this is still an Early Access release, some documented features may not yet be available. Please check the [release notes](https://github.com/clarisma/gol-tool/releases/tag/0.1.0) for details.

The following GitHub repositories are now publicly accessible:

- [`clarisma/geodesk`](http://www.github.com/clarisma/geodesk): This is the principal
  repository for the GeoDesk database engine toolkit.

- [`clarisma/gol-tool`](http://www.github.com/clarisma/gol-tool): The `gol` command-line 
  utility.

- [`clarisma/geodesk-examples`](http://www.github.com/clarisma/geodesk-examples): 
  Several small sample applications.

- [`clarisma/geodesk-tests`](http://www.github.com/clarisma/geodesk-tests):
  Integration tests and benchmarks.

Please visit our [download page](/download) for pre-built binaries, and check out the
[GeoDesk Tutorial](http://docs.geodesk.com/tutorial) for a quick introduction.

You will need to install the `gol` tool in order to build geographic object libraries 
from OpenStreetMap data. Alternatively, you can use the sample tile set (covering
Switzerland only), which is available at [https://data.geodesk.com/switzerland](https://data.geodesk.com/switzerland). Total size of this tile set is just under 400 MB. Tiles are
automatically downloaded if you specify this URL when opening a local GOL.

We appreciate your feedback! Reach out on GitHub if you run into difficulties, and follow [@GeoDeskTeam](http://www.twitter.com/GeoDeskTeam) to receive updates on future releases and other helpful tips about OpenStreetMap and geospatial software.
