# Geo-Object Query Language (GOQL)

<img class="float" src="query-type-tags.png" width=320>

**GOQL** is a concise syntax for describing queries in terms of **feature type** and **tags**. It is similar to [MapCSS](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS/0.2), which in turn is modeled after the original CSS (the *Cascading Style Sheets* used with HTML).

A **query** is composed of one or more **selectors**, which work like their CSS counterparts --- but instead of elements and their attributes, they filter features based on their type and tags.

Type must be one or more of the following:

<table>
<tr>
  <td markdown="1">
`n`
  </td>
  <td markdown="1">
Nodes
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td markdown="1">
`w`
  </td>
  <td markdown="1">
Ways (except areas)
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td markdown="1">
`a`
  </td>
  <td markdown="1">
Areas (can be ways or relations)
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td markdown="1">
`r`
  </td>
  <td markdown="1">
Relations (except areas)
  </td>
</tr>
<!--
<tr>
  <td markdown="1">
`w+`
  </td>
  <td markdown="1">
Ways (including areas)
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td markdown="1">
`r+`
  </td>
  <td markdown="1">
Relations (including areas)
  </td>
</tr>
-->
<tr>
  <td markdown="1">
`*`
  </td>
  <td markdown="1">
Any type
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

Type identifiers can be combined. For example, `na` selects both nodes and areas --- this is the most common combo, as points-of-interest in OSM are often represented as points or polygons.

To select all element types, use the wildcard `*`.

To further constrain features, add one or more **tag clauses**, which function like CSS attribute selectors:

```
na[amenity=restaurant]
```

The above selects all nodes and areas that have an `amenity` tag whose value is `restaurant`. If multiple tag clauses are specified, the feature must fulfill *all* of
them. For example, this query finds all sushi restaurants that offer takeaway and have a website:

```
na[amenity=restaurant][cusine=sushi][takeaway][website]
```

Tag clauses may appear in any order.

A **unary tag clause** tests for presence of a tag (whose value must not be `no`). Prepend it with `!` to negate it. For example, to find residential streets that are *not* one-way:

```
w[highway=residential][!oneway]
```

**Strings** that contain characters other than letters, numbers or underscores must be quoted (matching single or double quotes):

```
na[amenity=pub][name="The King's Head"]
```

For **partial string matches**, use the wildcard `*`:

```
na[name=The*]       // "The Best", "Theater"
na[name="The *"]    // "The Best"
na[name=*land]      // "bland", "New Zealand"
na[name=*eat*]      // "eatery", "Beat", "Theater"
```

String matching is always **case-sensitive**.

For more sophisticated string matching, use **regular expressions** (using the operator `~` or `!~`):

```
na[name~".[Ee]at."]      
```

A query can contain **multiple selectors**, separated by commas:

```
na[amenity=restaurant], na[amenity=pub], na[amenity=cafe]
```

The above can be simplified by specifying **multiple values** in a single tag clause:

```
na[amenity=restaurant,pub,cafe]
```

## Simplified form

Queries that select all types and contain a single tag clause can be written in **simplified form**, omitting the type identifiers and the square brackets:

```
highway=primary
```

is equivalent to

```
*[highway=primary]
```
